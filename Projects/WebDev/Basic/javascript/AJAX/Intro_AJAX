AJAX is Asychronous Javascript And XML, 
However xml is very rarely used . JSON(JS Object Notation) has taken over its place.
AJAX is a technique that help :  ( NOT a programming language.)
    Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
    Update a web page without reloading the page
    Send data to a web server - in the background

AJAX just uses a combination of:
    A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)



1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
